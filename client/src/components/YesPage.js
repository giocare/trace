// 'Did you know that the "triple identifier" of birthday, gender and zipcode is all that someone needs to uniquely identify atleast 87% of U.S. citizens in publicly available databases? <br>Data privacy is a global issue that affects billions of internet users each year. Consumers around the world are becoming increasingly worried about the protection of their online data. However, while data breaches have increased, awareness for data privacy continues to grow. Now more than ever, businesses and consumers alike are taking extra steps to safeguard their data and educate themselves on data privacy.<br>As Tim Cook said "Our own information is being weaponized against us with military efficiency.

These scraps of data, each one harmless enough on its own, are carefully assembled, synthesized, traded and sold."<br> What will you do to protect your data?
